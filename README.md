# March Madness ML

Predict NCAA championship win probabilities for Final Four teams using game data, team metrics, and Kalshi prediction market microstructure.

**2026 Final Four: Illinois, UConn, Michigan, Arizona — tournament in progress (as of 2026-04-05)**

---

## 2026 Predictions

| Team | Seed | Model P(Champion) | Market Implied |
|------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Michigan | 1 | 35.9% | 37.6% |
| Arizona | 1 | 33.2% | 37.8% |  
| Connecticut | 2 | 18.8% | 10.0% | 
| Illinois | 3 | 12.1% | 14.6% | 

| Team | Seed | Model P(Semi) | Market Implied |
|------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Michigan | 1 | 51.4% | ~50% |
| Arizona | 1 | 48.6% | ~50% |  
| Connecticut | 2 | 56.3% | 47% | 
| Illinois | 3 | 43.7% | 53% | 


Model and market disagree most on Connecticut (model favors strongly) and Arizona (market favors).

## How to Run

```bash
conda activate tasty
python -m feature_pipeline.run_v2 --data-dir data/ --output-dir output_v2/
```

Outputs to `output_v2/`: `team_season_features.csv`, `game_pairs.csv`, `cv_results.csv`, `feature_importance.csv`, `2026_predictions.csv`.

---

## Pipeline

The active pipeline is `feature_pipeline/run_v2.py`. It predicts "who wins this game?" across all ~1,400 historical tournament games (not just Final Four), then simulates the 2026 bracket via Monte Carlo.

## Data Sources

| Source | Location | What it has |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Kaggle game data | `data/kaggle/` | Game-by-game box scores 2003–2026, seeds, 200+ ranking systems |
| Team sheets | `data/team_sheets/` | NET, KPI, SOR, BPI, POM, SAG, SOS splits — Final Four teams 2005–2026 |
| Team stats | `data/{year}-team-stats/` | Season aggregate stats 2003–2026 |
| Kalshi markets | `data/market_data_store/` | Tick-level futures trades 2025–2026 (~696k trades) |

## Model Design

See `MODEL.md` for the full architecture, including:
- Why pairwise (Bradley-Terry style) over rank-4 modeling
- De Prado feature importance suite (MDI, MDA, SFI, CFI)
- Missing data strategy (binary missingness indicators)
- Meta-labeling with Kalshi as primary model

See `FEATURES.md` for the complete feature catalog.

## Key Constraints

- **No 2020**: Tournament cancelled (COVID). All loops skip 2020.
- **DayNum ≤ 132**: All pre-tournament features must use only regular season games.
- **2026 is test data only**: Do not use 2026 tournament results as training labels.
- **Treat 2026 as test**: `yearly_champions.csv` does not yet have 2026 results.
